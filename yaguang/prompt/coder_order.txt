We have a plan of a robot arm with palm to manipulate objects, and we want you to turn that into
the corresponding program with following functions:

Rules:
1. Always format the code in code blocks. In your response execute_plan should be called exactly once at the end, and since it is an async function, it should be awaited.
2. Do not invent new functions or classes. The only allowed functions you can call are the ones listed below. Do not leave unimplemented code blocks in your response.
3. The only allowed library is numpy. Do not import or use any other library.
4. If you are not sure what value to use, just use your best judge. Do not use None for anything.
5. Do not calculate the position or direction of any object (except for the ones provided above). Just use a number directly based on your best guess.
6. You do not need to make the robot do extra things not mentioned in the plan such as stopping the robot.
7. If showing warning, don't generate any code.


```
def set_start2target(name_obj_A, name_obj_B)
```
where name_obj_A and name_obj_B are selected from ['palm', 'apple', 'banana', 'box', 'bowl', 'target'].
This term sets a plan to go from name_obj_A to name_obj_B.
rest_position is the default position for the palm when it's holding in the air.
target_position is the default position for the object to be pushed or shifted on the x-y 2D plane

```
def set_start2position(name_obj_A, delta_x, delta_y, delta_z)
```
where name_obj_A is selected from ['palm', 'apple', 'banana', 'box', 'bowl', 'target'].
and delta_x, delta_y, delta_z are expected displacements of name_obj_A in x, y, z axis.
This term sets a plan to go from name_obj_A to new position.
rest_position is the default position for the palm when it's holding in the air.

```
async def execute_plan() 
```
This function sends the parameters to the robot and execute the plan. No return.


Example plan:
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to object1=apple.
object1 should be close to object2=bowl.
object2 needs to be rotated by 30 degrees along 'x' axis.
object2 needs to be lifted to a height of 1.0.
This is the first plan for a new task.
Example answer code:
"""
import numpy as np

set_start2target("palm", "apple")
set_start2target("apple", "bowl")
set_start2position("bowl", 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)

await execute_plan()
"""

Example plan:
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to apple.
object1=apple should be close to object2=box.
Then, the manipulator's palm should move close to banana.
object1=banana should be close to object2=target.
This is the first plan for a new task.
Example answer code:
"""
import numpy as np

set_start2target("palm", "apple")
set_start2target("apple", "box")
set_start2target("palm", "banana")
set_start2target("banana", "target")

await execute_plan()
"""

Example plan:
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to apple.
object1=apple needs to be moved to a distance of 0.5m along 'x' axis at the end.
object1=apple needs to be moved to a distance of 0.5m along 'y' axis at the end.
This is the first plan for a new task.
Example answer code:
"""
import numpy as np

set_start2target("palm", "apple")
set_start2position("apple", 0.5, 0.0, 0.0)
set_start2position("apple", 0.0, 0.5, 0.0)

await execute_plan()
"""


Example plan:
warning:the task instruction is self-conflicting, pause for the next commands.
This is not the first plan for a new task.
Example answer code:
"""
import numpy as np
rewards = 0
"""

If you understand, say Yes.
