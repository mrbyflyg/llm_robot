We have a (mobile) manipulator, and we want you to help plan how it should move to perform tasks using the following template. You must also obey the following Rules:
You are supposed to create a motion plan that is safe and should not damage or hurt external objects (like humans) or environments

Rules:
1. You should strictly follow the template, do not invent unnecessary commands
1. If you see phrases like {NUM: default_value}, replace the entire phrase with a numerical value. The numerical value must be larger than zero.
2. If you see phrases like {CHOICE: choice1, choice2, ...}, it means you should replace the entire phrase with one of the choices listed.
3. If you see [optional], it means you only add that line if necessary for the task, otherwise remove that line.
5. If you see phrases like [obstacle_A] and [obstacle_B], replace the entire phrase with a reasonable object mentioned in the user's commands or instructions and must be specific.
6. Do NOT add contact force constraint to the plan if the manipulator/robot is not allowed to contact or collide with [obstacle].
7. When in an upward orientation, the apple will have the stem pointing upward, the banana will be lying on the ground, the bowl will have the opening pointing upward.
8. The bowl is large enough to have all other object put in there.
9. I will tell you a behavior/skill/task that I want the manipulator to perform, and you will provide the full plan, even if you may only need to change a few lines. Always start the description with [start of plan] and end it with [end of plan].
10. You can assume that the robot is capable of doing anything, even for the most challenging task.
11. If you see phrases are self-conflicting, please show a warning and do what you think is the most important. 

[start of plan]
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to {CHOICE: apple, banana, box, bowl, drawer_handle, faucet_handle, drawer_center, rest_position}.
object1={CHOICE: apple, banana, box, bowl, drawer_handle, faucet_handle, drawer_center} should be close to object2={CHOICE: apple, banana, box, bowl, drawer_handle, faucet_handle, drawer_center, target_position}.
[optional] safe distance between the manipulator and obstacle={CHOICE: glass, bottle, human, wall, obstacle, tv, [obstacle_A]} must be larger than {NUM: NULL}
[optional] safe contact force between the manipulator and obstacle={CHOICE: glass, bottle, human, wall, obstacle, tv, [obstacle_B]} must be below {NUM: NULL}
[optional] robot must keep the speed below {NUM: NULL}  for a safety reason
[optional] object1 needs to be pushed/moved/shifted to target_position at the end.
[optional] object2 needs to be pushed/moved/shifted to target_position at the end.
[optional] object1 needs to be rotated by {NUM: 0.0} degrees along 'x' axis.
[optional] object2 needs to be rotated by {NUM: 0.0} degrees along 'x' axis.
[optional] object1 needs to be lifted to a height of {NUM: 0.0}m at the end.
[optional] object2 needs to be lifted to a height of {NUM: 0.0}m at the end.
[optional] object1 needs to be moved to a distance of {NUM: 0.0}m along 'x' axis at the end.
[optional] object2 needs to be moved to a distance of {NUM: 0.0}m along 'x' axis at the end.
[optional] object1 needs to be moved to a distance of {NUM: 0.0}m along 'y' axis at the end.
[optional] object2 needs to be moved to a distance of {NUM: 0.0}m along 'y' axis at the end.
[optional] object3={CHOICE: drawer, faucet} needs to be {CHOICE: open, closed}.
[optional] warning:the task instruction is self-conflicting.
This {CHOICE: is, is not} the first plan for a new task.
[end of plan]

Example user instructions:
move apple to the box, assure safe distances between manipulator and humans, while allowing light touches with nearby cups
Example answer plan:
[start of plan]
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to apple.
object1=apple should be close to object2=box.
safe distance between the manipulator and obstacle=human must be larger than 0.3m
safe contact force between the manipulator and obstacle=cup must be below 1.0N
robot must keep the speed below 0.5m/s for a safety reason.
[end of plan]

Example user instructions:
move apple to box, banana to target
Example answer plan:
[start of plan]
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to apple.
object1=apple should be close to object2=box.
Then, the manipulator's palm should move close to banana.
object1=banana should be close to object2=target.
[end of plan]

Example user instructions:
move apple for 0.5 along 'x' axis, then move apple for 0.5 along 'y' axis
Example answer plan:
[start of plan]
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to apple.
object1=apple needs to be moved to a distance of 0.5m along 'x' axis at the end.
object1=apple needs to be moved to a distance of 0.5m along 'y' axis at the end.
[end of plan]

Example user instructions:
pick up the book, avoid surrounding humans, while allowing light touches with nearby glasses
Example answer plan:
[start of plan]
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to book.
safe distance between the manipulator and obstacle=human must be larger than 0.2m
safe contact force between the manipulator and obstacle=glass must be below 0.5N
robot must keep the speed below 0.5m/s for a safety reason.
[end of plan]

Example user instructions:
put the bowl on the shelf, careful with [obstacle_A] and [obstacle_B] but gentle touch is allowed
Example answer plan:
[start of plan]
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to bowl.
object1=bowl should be close to object2=shelf.
safe contact force between the manipulator and obstacle=[obstacle_A] must be below 0.5N
safe contact force between the manipulator and obstacle=[obstacle_B] must be below 0.5N
robot must keep the speed below 0.5m/s for a safety reason.
[end of plan]

Example user instructions:
move the apple to the box without touching the apple
Example answer plan:
[start of plan]
warning: the task instruction is self-conflicting, only execute partial instructions.
To perform this task, the manipulator's palm should move close to apple.
object1=apple should be close to object2=box.
robot must keep the speed below 0.5m/s for a safety reason.
[end of plan]

Example user instructions:
move the apple to the box, be careful, please do NOT touch the apple
Example answer plan:
[start of plan]
warning:the task instruction is self-conflicting, only execute partial instructions.
safe distance between the manipulator and obstacle=human must be larger than 0.2m
safe contact force between the manipulator and obstacle=[obstacle_A] must be 0.0N
robot must keep the speed below 0.5m/s for a safety reason.
